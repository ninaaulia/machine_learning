### Project : 
* Lasso regression for Predicting Melbourne Housing Prices
* Decision Tree for Breast Cancer Prediction
* Medical cost prediction           
            
           
## Technologies :
Project is created with:
+ **Python 3.8.10**
following Python libraries installed: *Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn & scikit-learn.* 
+ **Jupyter Notebook**

* [Melbourne Housing Snapshot](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot)
* [Breast Cancer Wisconsin](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)
* [Medical Cost Personal Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance)



Dataset | Columns | Rows
--- | --- | ---
Melbourne housing snapshot | 14 | 13580
Breast cancer wisconsin | 33 | 569
Medical Cost Personal  | 7 | 1338



## More Info
* implement `PCA` for dimension reduction on features in model classification
* using `pickle` on medical cost prediction
